Libraries in this folder should:

* Be API compatible with the equivalent code exposed in the GoldSrc engine.
* Implement behaviour that is identical to that in the GoldSrc engine.

For example, the player movement library here should provide the same functionality as GoldSrc's original player movement code, only isolated into its own library.
